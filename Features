## Features

- **Trie Analysis** 
  Detects structural weaknesses in passwords, including **common prefixes, suffixes, and keyboard patterns**.

- **Hashing & Bloom Filter**   
  Performs **fast, privacy-preserving breach detection** of passwords against known datasets.

- **Probabilistic Guess Estimation** 
  Computes **expected number of guesses and entropy** using **Markov models** and **Dynamic Programming**.

- **Attack Simulation Engine**
  Simulates **BFS-guided attacks** using dictionary words and mutation rules to model real-world attacker behavior.

- **Risk Scoring & Feedback** 
  Generates a **multi-dimensional risk score** combining structural, probabilistic, and breach data, with **explainable feedback**.
