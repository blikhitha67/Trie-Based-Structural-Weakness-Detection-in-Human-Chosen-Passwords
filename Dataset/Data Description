This system analyzes password security using **algorithmic and data structure-based methods**.  

##Dataset Description – Advanced Secure Password Analysis
- Human-chosen passwords often follow **predictable patterns, keyboard sequences, and common mutations**.  
- **DSA techniques** like **Tries, Hashing, BFS, and DP** efficiently detect these weaknesses.  
- **Breach data and dictionaries** simulate **real-world attacks** and estimate **guessability**.  
- **Probabilistic models** compute **expected number of guesses** and **entropy**, providing a realistic risk score.  

## Use in Project
- **Trie Analysis:** Detect structural weaknesses in passwords.  
- **Hashing & Bloom Filter:** Fast and privacy-preserving breach detection.  
- **BFS Attack Simulation:** Generate possible attacker guesses efficiently.  
- **Risk Scoring:** Combine structural, probabilistic, and breach data for explainable feedback.
